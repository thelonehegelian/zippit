# Zippit, a social media app

Zippit is a unique social media platform that allows users to create "zips", a bundle of information sourced from various places to illustrate a single idea. It is designed to streamline the process of information sharing and consumption, focusing on thematic, curated content. With Zippit, users can compile articles, images, videos, and even snippets of text into a single zip, making it easier to communicate complex ideas or narratives. The platform emphasizes context and depth, allowing for a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of a topic, compared to the fragmented and often superficial nature of traditional social media feeds.
